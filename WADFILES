This, from the CVS log, from June 19, 2008:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

version 1.0 and demo wad files support:

the demo wad file support doesn't need a special configuration anymore.
besides, the --enable-demowad configuration option isn't an end-user
switch anymore:  it makes the compiled binary to work only with demo
(PC or Mac) version wad files and error-out otherwise.

added new configuration option, --enable-oldwad :  compiles the exe to
specifically use the 1.0 (shareware or retail) wad files, 1.1 wads are
rejected and errors out.  it configures the engine to MAXPLAYERS == 4
instead of the normal 8 value, it also makes the saved games signed with
2.36 instead of 2.37.

The striking difference between versions 1.0 and 1.1 is the MAXPLAYER
change: 1.0 supports 4 and 1.1 supports 8 players, and this results in
subtle problems.

Saves across different versions are not compatible. We are now signing
saves made with binaries configured with the oldwad option with 2.36
instead of 2.37: 2.36 is the signature which the 1.0 version used, but
remember, this doesn't mean the saves from those old dos versions are
supported, they are NOT.  The normal 8-player binary will sign the saves
with 2.37 as usual, and it will not care about with which wad it is
running with.

The worst thing is the recorded demos:  since there are no versioning
mechanisms, the demos saved with 4-player and 8-player versions are
incompatible.  I hacked a few things here:  basically, if a version-1.0
wad is detected, demo playback and recording is done according to 4
players.  but this isn't accurate, either.

in short, it seems like there are no problems with the binaries configured
with the demowad option (the 4-player binaries).  but if one is running
the normal 8-player binary with a 1.0 wad file, there may still be problems,
especially in the multiplayer code which we can't test at the moment.
another option would be to make the 8-player binary to error out with
version 1.0 (demo or full) wad files.  I'm open to ideas.
