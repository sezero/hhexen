HHexen v1.3 README

	HHexen is an enhanced Linux source port of the game Hexen by Raven
Software.  Its main purpose right now is to incorperate the assassin character
class from Hexen 2 into the original Hexen.  Also, some minor enhancements are
planned for later versions.  HHexen is not made or supported by Activision.

Features:

	- New character class: the assassin from Hexen 2
	- OpenGL rendering (thanks to Jaakko and Karl)
	- Normal and inverse mouselook
	- Higher in-game mouse sensitivity
	- In-game key configuration

Installation:

  X11 or SvgaLib:
	No special tricks are required to compile these.  Just unpack the 
  tarball and type "./configure".  If configure doesn't find any problems,
  type either "make x11" or "make svgalib" and you should be all set.

  OpenGL:
	To compile for OpenGL, just run configure with the --enable-gl switch.
  It will automatically check for the libGL.so and libGLU.so files, and if it
  doesn't find them, it will use the MesaGL and MesaGLU libraries instead.  
  If you want to use the MesaGL and MesaGLU libraries by default, run 
  configure with the switch --enable-gl-mesa instead of --enable-gl.

	It is very important that you run a "make clean" before compiling for
  OpenGL if you have previously compiled for X11.  The same is true when 
  compiling for X11 after previously compiling for OpenGL.
	
  Demo Wadfile:
	If you don't have the full version of Hexen, you can still play HHexen.
  The command for using the demo wad is "./configure --enable-demowad" and then
  "make".  Note that if you are using OpenGL and the demo wad, you will need to
  pass one of the arguments listed above to configure as well.
